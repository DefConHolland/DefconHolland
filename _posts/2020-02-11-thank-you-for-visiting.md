The dust has settled, the first DC3120 meetup was a great succes. We sure had fun and by the looks of it you did too.

We had a lot of fun presentations:
* Endpoint Detection Super Powers on the cheap by Olaf Hartong
* JSONs everywhere by Daniela
* Why Securit Professionals Should Write Code by Valentine
* In impromptu talk about Citrix and the (Security Meldpunt)[https://www.securitymeldpunt.nl] by Frank
* InfoSec != Hacking by Ciphernaut

We will ask all the speakers for any slide they used and will upload them here shortly.

Thanks again for visiting.
