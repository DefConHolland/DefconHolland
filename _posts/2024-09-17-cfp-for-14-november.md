No, we ain't dead yet. We had success full meetups on 1 Feb 2023 in Utrecht, and on 11 Aug 2023 and 9 Aug 2024 in Las Vegas, and we have a new edition planned on 14 November 2024 in [Bar Josefien](https://barjosefien.nl/) in Utrecht. And we promise to do better and bring you more events in the future.

For our next meetup we are still looking ofr speakers! If you want to give a talk and earn a limited edition DefCon Holland t-shirt, please fill in our [CFP Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd04S-lQQb5Q8oEM_SWW_86UL7HfWf9aZ-W1HTs2USoY-FIUg/viewform).
