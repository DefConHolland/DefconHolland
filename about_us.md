# We are DefCon Holland...

DefconHolland is the combined DC3115 and DC3120 group. Together we organize the DC3115 and DC3120 meetups.

DefCon Holland meetups are meetups for Dutch Hackers in a Dutch bar after work or school. We will have a stage with amazing speakers, some oldschool games and if you had too much beer & bitterballen you can do some hacker karaoke if you want.

# What is a DefCon group?

The DEF CON Groups were spawned from the annual DEF CON security conference in Las Vegas. The DEF CON Groups (DCGs or DC-Groups) are a gathering point for folks interested in the alternate applications of modern technology, referred to properly as 'hacking'. DCGs are not intended to compete with any other computer groups, such as 2600, but rather to provide yet another gathering place for the discussion of technology and security topics. DCG meetings are open to anyone, regardless of their skill, age, job, gender, etc. DCGs are designed to help you learn new things, meet new people, mentor others in areas you may be strong in, and provide some cohesion within the hacker culture and it's members.

# When/where does DefCon Holland meet?

The intention is to have 6 DefCon Holland meetups per year, three in Amsterdam (DC3120) and three in Delft (DC3115).

DC3115 meetups are usually held at Caf√© de Tobbe, DC3120 does not have a regular spot, yet.

# Do you need speakers

Yes we do! We want to give seasoned and starting speakers alike.

Anything hacky is a valid topic, not just information security.

Topics we had in the past:
* Wifi spotting
* Infosec
* Hacking != InfoSec (on arts and other stuff)

DefConb Holland is also a great place to get your feet wet and try out you talk.
